### Project Overview

This project is an assessment for data science conducted by Kovai.co. The objective is to analyze public transport passenger boarding data from April 1st, 2023 to April 30th, 2024, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predict patronage for the next 7 days (May 1st, 2024 to May 7th, 2024) using only the "MyWay" column.

### Files

### Task Breakdown

#### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze public transport passenger boarding data.
- Perform preliminary data analysis.
- Prepare a 1-2 page report highlighting key data insights.

#### Task 2: Prediction Using MyWay Column
- Use the "MyWay" column to predict patronage for the next 7 days (May 1st, 2024 to May 7th, 2024).
- Prepare a 1-2 page technical report outlining the prediction methodology and results.

### Dataset
